# 🏃🏼‍♂️🏃🏼‍♂️ Pro-Kabaddi Case study

Hi!, Welcome to the **Pro-Kabaddi Case Study**! The objective of this case study is to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing detailed event information from Kabaddi matches. 

---

# 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this case study is to gain insights into the gameplay, identify patterns, and uncover relationships between different match events and player performances. Students will learn to clean, manipulate, and visualize data using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# 📑 Dataset Details

The dataset used is the events dataset, which contains event-level data from Kabaddi matches with various columns. While we will focus on the events dataset, you are encouraged to explore and apply the same functions and techniques to other datasets available in the Kabaddi database provided in the drive.
